A popular streaming company has asked you to write a console 
app to help them keep track of available content.

They need to be able to see all their StreamingContent, Add 
new content, and remove content. They also would like a menu
for them to easily navigate through the application.


Using the respository pattern, create an application that allows
the user to create new content, see all content, and remove content. 
You should have a program user interface and method repository.
