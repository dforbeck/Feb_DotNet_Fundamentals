Streaming Content Challenge Prompt

Create a new console application. We are going to be building
a proof of concept for a streaming company. Right now they will 
only be streaming movies and tv shows.
We will need a 
Streaming Content object class (this will hold our properties)
Our properties will be ContentName, ContentType (tv show or movie),
ContentRating, ContentTime, ContentGenre (action, scifi, etc)


Program.cs which will be already built for us when we create the
console app.

We need a ProgramUI.cs where our Console commands and prompts for the 
user to know where to go.

And a repository class to hold our methods such as adding to a list,
removing from a list, getting the list from our repository and remove
from a list. These methods would not be considered low fruit so 
don't start with these.

We will also need a unit test project for the methods in our 
Repository.

The user should be able to input the values
for the StreamingContent object properties, They should be able to
see all of the current StreamingContent objects, and remove a object.
