A popular streaming company has asked you to write a console 
app to help them keep track of their streaming service. 


They need to be able to see all their StreamingContent, Add 
new content, and remove content. They also would like a menu
for them to easily navigate through the application. 

They also want to add a new feature that allows a user to create a 
queue of content they would like to watch. They would need to be able
to watch a show and add a new show to the list.


Using the respository pattern, create an application that allows
the user to create new content, see all content, and remove content. 
You should have a program user interface and method repository. 

You should also use a Queue to allow the company to create a Queue of 
content for a customer.
